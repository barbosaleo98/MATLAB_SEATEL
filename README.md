# MATLAB_SEATEL

Repository containing simple MATLAB scripts used for a introductory MATLAB course taught by the author of this repository in the SEATEL 2021 event from the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR).

The course was presented remotely, had a total of 4 hours divided in two sessions and covered the following subjects:

- Basic programming concepts;
- Scripts development;
- Custom function definition;
- Operation with arrays and matrices;
- Signal generation and filtering;
- Graph plotting and customization;
- Working with external data in .txt and .csv formats;
- How to export a LiveScript report;
- Practical examples of MATLAB usage in the routine of an Electrical Engineering.
 
Included in this repo is a folder called **Scripts** containing the sample scripts that were presented and a folder called **Slides** where the pdf presentations of the two sessions are present. 

> ⚠️ At the moment, the contents of both directories are in Portuguese due to the fact that the presentation was done for students of a Brazilian university, but in the future a translation may be provided.
